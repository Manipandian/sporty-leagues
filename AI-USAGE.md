# AI Tools Usage

### 1. Cursor AI - Autocomplete
**Purpose:** Code acceleration and productivity enhancement

**How it helped:**
- Used Cursor's tab-based autocompletion throughout the development process
- Accelerated component structure scaffolding (React functional components, TypeScript interfaces)
- Speeded up repetitive code patterns (import statements, prop types, event handlers)
- Assisted with MUI component syntax and prop suggestions

### 2. Cursor AI - Documentation Generation
**Purpose:** Documentation formatting with plain text input. THis AI-USAGE and APP_DESIGN, README files are formatted as a professional document by cursor

**How it helped:**
- Converted plain text notes into properly formatted markdown for documentation files
- Generated this AI-USAGE.md file with proper structure
- Formatted APP-DESIGN.md with clear sections and professional presentation

## Impact on Development

The AI tools primarily served to:
1. **Reduce boilerplate time** - Faster component and interface creation
2. **Maintain consistency** - Uniform code patterns across the application
3. **Improve documentation** - Clear, well-structured markdown documentation
4. **Focus on logic** - More time spent on business logic rather than syntax

## Note
The core architecture, design decisions, and implementation logic were developed independently. AI tools were used as productivity enhancers rather than decision-makers, allowing more focus on the product requirements and user experience.
